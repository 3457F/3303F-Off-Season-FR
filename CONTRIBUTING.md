# Introduction
Welcome to the repository for team 3457F's off-season robot code! This file aims to be a starting point for anybody (by which I mean *cough* team members *cough*) looking to contribute to our codebase! It's mainly composed of guidelines on how to contribute, such as how to format issues.

# Issue Formatting
When filing an issue, please make sure to check that...
- you have **assigned** someone to check up on and solve the issue. Usually, [CodeMyGame1](https://github.com/CodeMyGame1) will be part of these assignees, as he is the main coder for the team.
- you have added **labels** to the issue. this ensures that higher priority issues will be attended to first, and it's immediately clear how breaking a change will be, or how difficult it will be to solve an issue
- you have assigned a **project**. For now, just assign it to the 3457F organization's main project, also named [3457F](https://github.com/orgs/3457F/projects/2)
- you have added a **milestone**. This helps group related issues and show a broader picture of the progress we're making towards our goals

As for the actual issue content:
- **Title:** Have a clear, concise title that conveys the action that needs to be taken (i.e. "**Add** Custom Autonomous Selector," "**Implement** Automatic PID Tuning, or "**Convert** Autonomous Routines To Pure Pursuit").
  - This helps contributors easily locate the issue they're working on, and get the gist of all the issues on the project dashboard, without having to look through each one individually.
- **Description:** Use the following format in your issue's description:

```
**Problem:** <the problem that this issue is highlighting, or that this issue will solve>
**Significance:** <why is the problem so problematic? what is the SIGNIFICANCE of solving the problem? can usually be omitted for QoL issues (issues tagged with the "enhancement" label)>
**Solution:** <a step-by-step solution, with required libraries, components, or other types of code that need to be created or modified in order to solve the identified problem>
```
